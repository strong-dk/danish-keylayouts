# Danish ISO keyboard keylayout files for MacOS
This folder contains custom keylayout files so that the keyboards below can be used with MacOS.
I have used them on a daily basis so they should be good, but let me know if anything is wrong.

**Varmilo VA88M TKL**: 
This has no native Mac mode, so most keys were remapped.

**Lofree Flow 100**: Most keys were ok out of the box when you set the keyboard to MAC mode (FN + M)
However, brackets ({}), @-sign, backslash and others were incorrect and have been changed in this file.

### Installation
1. Copy the .keylayout and .icns files to
    `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
(From finder it can be opened via shift + command + G)

2. Log out and back in

3. Open Settings -> Keyboard:
   - Under Text Input -> Input Sources choose Edit
   - Select + to add a new keybaord
   - Scroll all the way to the bottom, where you should find it under "Others"
